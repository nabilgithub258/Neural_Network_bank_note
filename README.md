# Bank Note Classification Neural Network Model

## Overview
This R script implements a neural network model to classify banknotes as either genuine or counterfeit based on several features extracted from images of the banknotes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains:
- **Variance**: Variance of wavelet transformed image.
- **Skewness**: Skewness of wavelet transformed image.
- **Curtosis**: Curtosis of wavelet transformed image.
- **Entropy**: Entropy of image.

These features were extracted from grayscale images using wavelet transformation.

## Usage
Please read the pdf file which is a RMarkdown file converted to pdf for a clean and better understanding of the project, it also contains all the packages needed to run this model.
